      "Q: What is inside of a computer?\n",
      "A: A computer is the main circuit board in a computer, providing a platform for the CPU, memory, and other components to communicate with each other. It connects all hardware parts, such as the CPU, RAM, storage, and peripheral devices. It basically holds everything together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What does a CPU do in a computer system?\n",
      "A: The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the brain of the computer. It executes instructions from programs, performs calculations, and controls data flow within the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What is RAM (Random Access Memory)?\n",
      "A: RAM is temporary memory used by the computer to store data that is currently in use or being processed. It is much faster than storage drives and allows quick access to data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How does a hard drive differ from an SSD?\n",
      "A: A hard drive (HDD) uses spinning disks to store data, whereas an SSD (Solid State Drive) uses flash memory. SSDs are faster, more durable, and consume less power than HDDs. However, SSDs are more expensive and tend to have a shorter life than HDDs because their flash chips wear out eventually and their technology is more advanced. The spinning discs in hard drives can last much longer and are cheaper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Should I use a HDD or an SSD?\n",
      "A: It depends on your needs. Since hard drives are slow but cheaper, they are great for storing data such as documents, media, projects, and such. SSDs are far much quicker, so they are great for running the operating system, programs, and storing other system/program data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What is a GPU and what does it do?\n",

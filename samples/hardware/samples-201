: RAM), stores data that the GPU uses to render images, textures, and video. More VRAM allows for better performance in graphics-intensive tasks.

Q: What is UEFI?
A: UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is a modern version of BIOS that provides faster boot times, a more flexible user interface, and greater compatibility with larger drives and newer hardware.

Q: What is a SATA port used for?
A: A SATA (Serial ATA) port is used to connect storage devices, such as hard drives or SSDs, to the motherboard for data transfer.

Q: What is a thunderbolt port used for?
A: A Thunderbolt port is a high-speed data and video connection that can transfer data, video, and power simultaneously. It is commonly used for connecting external drives and monitors.

Q: What is a VR headset and how does it connect to a computer?
A: A VR headset is a device that immerses the user in virtual reality by displaying a 3D environment. It connects to a computer via HDMI, USB, or sometimes DisplayPort and requires a powerful GPU to render the virtual environment.

Q: What is a surge protector used for?
A: A surge protector safeguards computer components from power surges or spikes by diverting excess voltage to the ground, preventing damage to the hardware.











Q: What is the difference between a laptop and desktop CPU?
A: A desktop CPU generally has higher clock speeds and more cores than a laptop CPU, which is designed to be power-efficient and compact for mobile use.

Q: What is a wireless card used for in a computer?
A: A wireless card allows a computer to connect to a Wi-Fi network, providing internet access without the need for cables.

Q: What is the function of a CMOS battery?
A: The CMOS battery powers the system's real-time clock and maintains BIOS settings when the computer is powered off.

Q: What is a motherboard form factor?
A: The motherboard form factor refers to the size, shape, and layout of a motherboard. Common form factors include ATX, microATX, and Mini-ITX.

Q: What is a digital-to-analog converter (DAC)?
A: A DAC converts digital audio signals from a computer into analog signals that can be used by speakers or headphones.

Q: What is a cryptographic accelerator in a CPU?
A: A cryptographic accelerator is a specialized processor designed to speed up cryptographic operations, such as encryption and decryption, to improve security and performance.

Q: What is the difference between VGA, DVI, and HDMI?
A: VGA (Video Graphics Array) is an analog video connection; DVI (Digital Visual Interface) supports both analog and digital signals, while HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) supports both video and audio in a digital format.

Q: What does an integrated GPU mean?
A: An integrated GPU is a graphics processor built into the CPU or motherboard, offering basic graphics capabilities without the need for a separate graphics card.

Q: What is ECC memory?
A: ECC (Error-Correcting Code) memory automatically detects and corrects memory errors, providing greater stability and reliability, especially in servers and workstations.

Q: What is a network switch?
A: A network switch is a device that connects multiple devices within a local area network (LAN) and directs data packets to the correct destination based on MAC addresses.

Q: What is a wireless router used for?
A: A wireless router allows multiple devices to connect to the internet wirelessly. It manages the network traffic and provides access to the internet via a broadband connection.

Q: What is a thunderbolt docking station?
A: A Thunderbolt docking station provides expanded connectivity options by offering multiple ports (USB, Ethernet, HDMI, etc.) via a single Thunderbolt cable, making it easier to connect multiple devices to a laptop.

Q: What is the function of a chipset in relation to memory?
A: The chipset manages the data flow between the CPU, RAM, and other system components. It ensures that the CPU accesses memory efficiently and that memory is used optimally.

Q: What is an SSD controller?
A: An SSD controller is a microprocessor within the solid-state drive that manages data storage and retrieval, error correction, wear leveling, and communication with the motherboard.

Q: What does "overclocking" mean?
A: Overclocking refers to increasing the clock speed of a component, such as the CPU or GPU, beyond the manufacturer's specified limits to achieve higher performance.

Q: What is a thermal throttling mechanism?
A: Thermal throttling is a safety mechanism that reduces a component's performance (

======== SAMPLE 1 ========

Why, the gods! I thank thy grace! Thou hast set mine tongue upon thy own;--
Whereon, behold, I am a good fellow,
Hath done thee no wrong: I have not deserved
For it in what I have done, nor will
Whose fault it are, to break the law, whose
foot it be, that did break mine;
But, from thee my will, that I am not wrong'd,
Is, I say, to kill me here, for I have had
A mighty foul curse:--
O, the gods! I have slain thee
In my rage, whereon, my mind shall drown:
Now I know thy fault!

GLOUCESTER:
O my lord, where's a villain?

LUCENTIO:
O my lord! thou hast a villain;
And I must slay him there; 'tis to prove
How I am wrong'd! But then what?

LUCENTIO:
So, what is it! thou liest me to murder thee,
For I am well acquainted with my fault.

LUCENTIO:
O my lord!

GLOUCESTER:
O, my lord!

LUCENTIO:
O, my lord!

GLOUCESTER:
O, my lord!

CLARENCE:
O, Claudio!
Why dost thou hast brought hither these men?

GLOUCESTER:
O, Claudio!

GLOUCESTER:
What?

CLARENCE:
My friends! I am the king! I have done wrong'd to thee, thy father;
Had my father been so mean as I am, I never could have deserved
My father to be so mild. Now, O my lord,
I'll have thee slain in thy hand; 'tis not my fault;
But this is the curse on thee!

GLOUCESTER:
Your good lord, O god! Thy heart's blood shall be shed at your death!
Your highness! What an accident!
O, God! What an accident!
My father, my father! what a misfortune!

CLARENCE:
O god! Thou hast cut off our daughter from our land!
What, what! my prayers are so high;
Why, my prayers are high; that is the curse!

GLOUCESTER:
Where is thy daughter? O god,

CLARENCE:
O God! What's this!
Thou hast cut off our daughter: where is her daughter?
O evil devil! O, what is this!
Where is our mother? O wicked devil!

GLOUCESTER:
O God! I have cut off my children's blood
Unto thy knee to thy throat:
O thou bad monster, I have cut off my father!
O thou beast!
Why, what then! Thou art evil:
O my lord!

GLOUCESTER:
Dost thou sever my life to death?
And why shouldst thou slaughter our father?
What then is thy daughter? O evil devil!
Who is thy daughter? Where, my lords! I pray you, is I?
Where is my mother? My lord, my lord!
O villain! My lord! O villain!
O thou bad monster,
What now! Thou wert the daughter of thy father!
Where have we put thy daughter to pain?
Where are we bound to stand upon? O good lord!
What, where are we forsworn? O good lord!
O villain! What's this!
What, we have laid aside thy life to death!
Why, O good lord!
O evil devil! What's this!
O good villain!

GLOUCESTER:
Then let me be thy lord,
To make thee my lord; for Thou hast set me off!

CLARENCE:
I have made thee a foul foul devil
By my father's blood, to give thy son revenge:
This thou have made me a traitor:
That thou wast our daughter, or we should be our daughter
We shall know the meaning of this:
O, how thy wrong! O, how it was set upon!
O, how we should have lived! O, why shouldst thou burn us to death?

CLARENCE:
Ay, O heaven! thou hast made me
A foul foul devil, to be our keeper!

GLOUCESTER:
O prince of Rome! Come to me,
Or else with aught I can be.

CLARENCE:
O I have wrong'd thee before:
My highness! I am the
